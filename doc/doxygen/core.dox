/** @defgroup FCL Fawkes Core Library
 * The Fawkes Core Library includes core components that are required to write
 * basic fawkes plugins.  This is the lowest level in the Fawkes library stack
 * and must not depend  on any other libraries besides glibc and system calls.
 *
 * The Fawkes Core Library provides several basic features  needed by the rest
 * of the software like:
 *  - Multi-Threading tools (threads, locking, synchronization)
 *  - Exceptions (base class for exceptions, basic generic exceptions)
 *  - Plugin (base class for Fawkes Plugins)
 *  - Core Utils (utility aspects for Fawkes software, see below)
 *
 * In most cases if you look for a place to put you code you are wrong here in
 * the core library.  You must really know what you are doing. If in doubt ask
 * Tim Niemueller for decision making help for this. In general if you thought
 * you  should add  something to  core it is  likely that  the right  place is
 * somewhere in the Fawkes Utility Library.
 *
 * You will note that here is also an utils directory which may make you think
 * even more that you want to put your code here.  But the utils is only meant
 * to host utilities that are
 * - small in code size
 * - needed in Fawkes components that cannot depend on utils
 * - are widely used
 * - fulfill an atomic task
 * - will not be used but rather are  aspects of software that  you write and
 *   where classes derive these utility classes.
 *
 * The exceptions directory is  _not_  a general place to put your exceptions.
 * It is only  meant to serve as a  repository of generic  exceptions that are
 * likely to be  re-used all  over the software.   On the  one hand  these are
 * system exceptions which are mainly applicable if the error was indicated or
 * described  via the  usage of errno.   On the other  hand these  are generic
 * software construction exceptions like null pointer exceptions.
 *
 * Rule of thumb: Use Fawkes Core Library, don't hack it.
