graph-name: Example
root: Origin

default-properties:
    # Max. distance between actual and target positions to deem the target
    # reached. This value is for intermediate nodes on a path; m
    # The value can be overwritten per node in the graph file.
    - travel_tolerance: 0.7

    # Max. distance between actual and target positions to deem the target
    # reached. This value is for the last node on a path; m
    # The value can be overwritten per node in the graph file.
    - target_tolerance: 0.7

    # Max. distance between actual and target orientation to deem the target
    # reached. This value is for the last node on a path; rad
    - orientation_tolerance: 0.6

    # When following a plan the robot will check all upcoming nodes if they
    # are close to the robot within this tolerance. If so, they take a shortcut
    # and will go to the node in the plan after the shortcut node.
    # This is potentially dangerous depending on the graph and navigator as it
    # might violate the typical graph constraint of only having direct-line-of-tavel
    # connections. The value can be overidden with a node property of the same name; m
    - shortcut_tolerance: 1.2

    # Example for some custom, domain-specific default property
    - custom_value: 0.45
