graph-name: Example
root: Origin

default-properties:
  # Max. distance between actual and target positions to deem the target
  # reached. This value is for intermediate nodes on a path; m
  # The value can be overwritten per node in the graph file.
  - travel_tolerance: 0.7

  # Max. distance between actual and target positions to deem the target
  # reached. This value is for the last node on a path; m
  # The value can be overwritten per node in the graph file.
  - target_tolerance: 0.7

  # Max. distance between actual and target orientation to deem the target
  # reached. This value is for the last node on a path; rad
  - orientation_tolerance: 0.6

  # When following a plan the robot will check all upcoming nodes if they
  # are close to the robot within this tolerance. If so, they take a shortcut
  # and will go to the node in the plan after the shortcut node.
  # This is potentially dangerous depending on the graph and navigator as it
  # might violate the typical graph constraint of only having direct-line-of-tavel
  # connections. The value can be overidden with a node property of the same name; m
  - shortcut_tolerance: 1.2

  # Example for some custom, domain-specific default property
  - custom_value: 0.45
