  # If true quit Fawkes on disconnect from Robotino Com server, otherwise
  # retry connection. If run from LCD menu should be set to true.

  deadman_time_threshold: 0.5

  # Base coordinate frame
  base_frame: !frame base_link

  # Minimum time in milliseconds between two Robotino sensor readings.
  # Lower values increase the machine load (considerably) but decrease
  # the average sensor data age. Zero means receive as fast as possible
  # without waiting between receive calls
  sensor_update_cycle_time: 5

  bumper:
    # Set to true to enable the emergency stop on bumper contact (provided
    # by OpenRobotino, or false to keep going (warning, you should handle
    # bumper contact by yourself then!).
    estop_enabled: true

  gyro:
    # Enable Gyro publishing? This creates an IMUInterface and publishes
    # the gyro data if available via OpenRobotino. If enabled and the gyro
    # is not available, properly writes "-1 invalid indicator" (cf. IMUInterface)
    # If disabled, no interface will be opened and written. Recommended if you
    # intend to use the imu plugin for gyro access
    # If you enable this, you should also set the odometry mode to copy
    enable: true
    
    # Gyro coordinate frame

    interface_id: IMU Robotino

  odometry:

    # Odometry mode, one of "calc" or "copy"
    # calc: calculate on our own based on IMUInterface and velocity data
    # copy: copy values as-is from OpenRobotino
    # If you set this to calc, you should disable the gyro support in the
    # robotino plugin and instead use the imu plugin with the gyro connected
    # directly to the Fawkes machine.

      # Number of loops after which the IMU is considered dead if no
      # change has been made to the interface (but it still has a writer).
      # In that case the odometry will be based solely on wheel odometry.
      imu_deadman_loops: 3

      # Correction factors for odometry calculation
      correction:
        # If wheel odometry is used (not the gyro) multiple the odometry delta
        # with this factor, that is an empirical value that you need to
        # adjust to your specific robot. Default (1.0) means no adjustment.
