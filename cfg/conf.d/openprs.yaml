  # Configuration related to mp-oprs
  message-passer:
    # Run the message passer explicitly? Disabling this allows to
    # run mp-oprs on your own. Note that if it is run neither by
    # Fawkes nor by yourself it will be started automatically by
    # openprs-server and not be stopped on exit.
    run: true

    # can be in PATH or an absolute path
    binary: mp-oprs

    # OpenPRS is quite picky about the hostname. Set this only
    # if you run mp-oprs yourself on a _remote_ host.

    # The TCP port that mp-oprs listens on for connections.
    # If mp-oprs is started by Fawkes it will be instructed to
    # listen on that port. If disabled, this is where we expect
    # to be able to communicate with the message passer.
    tcp-port: !tcp-port 3300

    # Use a proxy for message passer communication?
    # If enabled it will print forwarded messages in the log file.

  # Configuration related to oprs-server
  server:

    # run oprs-server when the openprs plugin is loaded and
    # terminate it when the plugin is unloaded.

    # multiple robot instances for simulation on a single machine.
