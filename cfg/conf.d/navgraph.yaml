  # Graph file to use for path planning

  # Max. distance between actual and target positions to deem the target
  # reached. This value is for intermediate nodes on a path; m
  # The value can be overwritten per node in the graph file.
  # NOTE: it is recommended to set this as graph default property
  travel_tolerance: 0.25

  # Max. distance between actual and target positions to deem the target
  # reached. This value is for the last node on a path; m
  # The value can be overwritten per node in the graph file.
  # NOTE: it is recommended to set this as graph default property

  # When following a plan the robot will check all upcoming nodes if they
  # are close to the robot within this tolerance. If so, they take a shortcut
  # and will go to the node in the plan after the shortcut node.
  # This is potentially dangerous depending on the graph and navigator as it
  # might violate the typical graph constraint of only having direct-line-of-tavel
  # connections. The value can be overidden with a node property of the same name; m
  # NOTE: it is recommended to set this as graph default property

  replan_interval: 2.0

  # Cost factor to decide whether to use new or old plan after re-planning.
  # The cost of the old (remaining partial) plan is multiplied with this
  # factor and then compared to the new plan's cost. Only if the new plan
  # is not more expensive than this result, it is used.
  # For example, when setting this to 1.0, the new plan is only considered
  # if it is at most as expensive as the current plan. When setting this to
  # 2.0, the new plan may be up to twice as expensive as the current plan
  # to switch.
  replan_cost_factor: 1.5

  # Update the visualization at this interval. This will trigger a compuation
  # of all constraints and if any change occurs the graph will be published

  # If set to true, aborts traveling on error, e.g. if no writer exists for
  # the NavigatorInterface. If false, keeps trying and re-sending.
