  # When following a plan the robot will check all upcoming nodes if they
  # are close to the robot within this tolerance. If so, they take a shortcut
  # and will go to the node in the plan after the shortcut node.
  # This is potentially dangerous depending on the graph and navigator as it
  # might violate the typical graph constraint of only having direct-line-of-tavel
  # connections. The value can be overidden with a node property of the same name; m
