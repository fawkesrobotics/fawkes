  # Interval in which to replan if constraints have been modified
  # since the last path planning.
  replan_interval: 2.0

  # Cost factor to decide whether to use new or old plan after re-planning.
  # The cost of the old (remaining partial) plan is multiplied with this
  # factor and then compared to the new plan's cost. Only if the new plan
  # is not more expensive than this result, it is used.
  # For example, when setting this to 1.0, the new plan is only considered
  # if it is at most as expensive as the current plan. When setting this to
  # 2.0, the new plan may be up to twice as expensive as the current plan
  # to switch.
  replan_cost_factor: 1.5

  # Update the visualization at this interval. This will trigger a compuation
  # of all constraints and if any change occurs the graph will be published
  # again. This is done whether the robot is currently driving or standing still.

  # If set to true, aborts traveling on error, e.g. if no writer exists for
  # the NavigatorInterface. If false, keeps trying and re-sending.
  # Setting this to false is risky, because skills then cannot react to an
  # error because none is reported. It is recommended to set this to false
  # only if you really know what you are doing.

  # Allow that there are multiple graph segments without interconnect.
  # This can also be useful, for example, if there are explicitly unconnected
  # nodes in the graph, for example to store semantic information but which

  # The following enables or disables path execution.
  # In either case a navgraph is maintained internally, paths may be
  # planned, and searches performed. However, if disabled, paths may
  # not be executed by the navgraph plugin. This can be useful, for
  # example, to keep the navgraph data structure around and use
  # ros-navgraph-breakout for external execution. Disabling
  # essentially means that no blackboard interfaces for path
  # instruction will be provided and the remaining API is kept
  # as-is.

    # maximum scale value for the cost denotes when this should be
    # saturated and thus yellow, i.e.  a setting of 2.0 means that a
    # cost factor of 1.0 will be drawn as red, 1.5 as orange, and
    # anything greater or equal to 2.0 as yellow.
