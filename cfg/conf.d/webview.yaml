  # cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
  # This concerns requests where the web app does not originate from
  # the same server as the URL requested. An example is running the
  # webview frontend locally in development mode or to access multiple
  # robots from one interface.
  #
  # Modern browsers will only process resources if the server allows
  # access through the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.
  # cf https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
  # or https://enable-cors.org/

  #   jpeg-vflip: true/false
  # J is the JPEG quality balancing file size and quality, range 1-100,
  #   depends on actual compressor used
  #   For libjpeg 70 or 80 are good values, for MMAL (Raspberry Pi) 5-10 are fine
  # F Number of frames per second for MJPEG-streams
  # Vertical flipping can be enabled, e.g. for ceiling cameras

  # directories with static files
  htdocs:

    # If the catchall file is set, the static file processor will
    # listen to /{file+}. Any file, that it cannot resolve within the
    # htdocs dir, will result in serving the given file.
    # For example, for the Angular frontend, this must be the
    # index.html file. The 404 response is then generated by the
    # Angular app (usually redirecting to the front page)
    catchall-file: index.html

    # Typically this is provided by mailcap in /etc/mime.types.

  # For the given URLs, a handler will be configured that captures
  # requests if no other handler is registered, i.e., the actual
  # plugin handling these requests has not been loaded.
  # If this is not a user-facing page, but rather an endpoint ingested
  # by some program, this may provide better feedback.
  # For user pages, with the appropriate catchall above, we always
  # serve the UI and it will do something useful.
