  # J is the JPEG quality balancing file size and quality, range 1-100,
  #   depends on actual compressor used
  #   For libjpeg 70 or 80 are good values, for MMAL (Raspberry Pi) 5-10 are fine
  # F Number of frames per second for MJPEG-streams
  # Vertical flipping can be enabled, e.g. for ceiling cameras
