  # Configuration settings for the joystick-teleop plugin
  # The example configuration is suitable for an Xbox 360 controller
  teleop:
    # Axes index for forward/backward, sideward, and rotational movement
    # To find out the proper axes for your joystick run:
    # jstest /dev/input/js0
    # (replace the device path with the device_file configured above)
    # Then move the axis you want to use and note and set its index here
    axis_forward:  1
    axis_sideward: 0
    axis_rotation: 3

    # Accept axis value if its absolute value is above this threshold
    axis_threshold: 0.2

    # Deadman settings, only if the button or axis is active movement
    # commands are executed. As soon as they are released the robot stops.
    # At least one of the two methods must be configured, or the robot
    # won't move at all.
    
    # Deadman axis
    # Configure an axis and a threshold. For a negative threshold,
    # movement is allowed if the axis value is less than the given value.
    # If positive, movements are executed if the axis value is greater
    # than the configured value. To disable using an axis as deadman
    # switch comment out the following line.
    deadman_axis: 5
    deadman_axis_threshold: -0.1

    # Deadman button
    # The button mask is AND'ed to the JoystickInterface::pressed_buttons
    # field. If the resulting value is non-zero, the robot executes
    # movement commands. To get the appropriate value sum up values of
    # the appropriate BUTTON_* constants of the JoystickInterface.
    # To react to all buttons, set value to 4294967295.
    deadman_button_mask: 4294967295

    # Drive mode switching
    # Certain button or an axis can be configured that will allow to
    # use a different drive mode as long as the button is pushed.
    # The initial drive mode is "normal". As long as any of the
    # drive mode switching conditions below applies, the "special"
    # drive mode is used.
    # For example, during demos you can default to a slow "normal"
    # mode and allow for a faster special for more experienced users.
    # The other way around can be used for normal cruising speed and
    # special slower speed for fine movement.
    # The conditions work the same way as the deadman switch documented
    # above.
