/* This is a hack to achieve the following: when the nao plugin is loaded,
 * we want to get access to the main broker for shared access within Fawkes.
 * However, for some reason the ALBrokerManager singleton is different in
 * the naofawkes NaoQi module that embeds Fawkes, and the nao plugin that
 * runs inside Fawkes.
 * This single extern declaration is intended to transport the broker from
 * the NaoQi module to the Fawkes plugin.
