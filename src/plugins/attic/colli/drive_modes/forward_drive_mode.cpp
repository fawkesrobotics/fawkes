/** Calculate by given variables a new rotation to give for the motor to minimize curvature.
 *
 *  DOC.: This here is the most complicated part in realizing the colli. By the given information
 *        I have to calculate a rotation I want to achieve in an optimal way.
 *        Here this is solved in an interesting way:
 *        First, check how long the curvature is, we want to drive to the target. This is done by
 *        approximating the size of the triangle around this curvature given by collision and
 *        and targetpoint and the angle between those both. Afterwards the time we have to drive
 *        with constant speed is calculated. Now we have the time we want to turn the angle. By
 *        multiplying this with a high constant (here 4), we rotate faster than we want to, but
 *        so the curvatures are not so extraordinary big. Afterwards there is an proportional
 *        part added, so we have a control factor here. (P-Regler ;-) )
 *
 *  @return A desired rotation.
