 * abstract class is then implemented by threads interacting with a particular
 * pan/tilt unit.
 *
 * Each implementation of this thread shall open an instance of a PanTiltInterface
 * and act within this thread's loop() method. The data read back from the unit
 * shall be written in the update_sensor_values() method, that is called from
 * the PanTiltSensorThread.
