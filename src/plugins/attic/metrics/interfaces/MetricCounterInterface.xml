		  A counter is a cumulative metric that represents a single
		  numerical value that only ever goes up. A counter is typically
		  used to count requests served, tasks completed, errors occurred,
		  etc. Counters should not be used to expose current counts of
		  items whose number can also go down, e.g. the number of
		  currently running threads. Use gauges for this use case.
