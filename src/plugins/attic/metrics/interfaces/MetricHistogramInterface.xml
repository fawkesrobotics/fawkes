		  A histogram samples observations (usually things like request
		  durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable
		  buckets. It also provides a sum of all observed values.

		  A histogram with a base metric name of *basename* exposes
		  multiple time series during a scrape:

		  - cumulative counters for the observation buckets, exposed as
		    *basename*_bucket{le="*upper inclusive bound*"}

		  - the total sum of all observed values, exposed as *basename*_sum

		  - the count of events that have been observed, exposed as
		    *basename*_count (identical to *basename*_bucket{le="+Inf"}
		    above)

		  When operating on buckets, remember that the histogram is
		  cumulative. See histograms and summaries for details of
		  histogram usage and differences to summaries.

		  The interface supports histograms of up to 16 buckets.
