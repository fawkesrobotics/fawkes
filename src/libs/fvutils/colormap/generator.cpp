/** @class ColormapGenerator <fvutils/colormap/generator.h>
 * Interface for colormap generators.
 *
 * @fn void ColormapGenerator::set_buffer(unsigned char *buffer, unsigned int width, unsigned int height)
 * Set image buffer.
 * Set the image buffer that is to be considered next.
 * @param buffer image buffer (YUV422 planar format assumed)
 * @param width width of image in pixels
 * @param height height of image in pixels
 *
 * @fn Colormap *  ColormapGenerator::get_current()
 * Get the current colormap.
 * With this method you can access the current LUT. This is useful to display the
 * current results as "what would happen if we'd use this LUT?".
 * @return current colormap
 *
 * @fn void ColormapGenerator::consider()
 * Considers the given buffer and extracts the needed information.
 * @see set_buffer()
 *
 * @fn void ColormapGenerator::calc()
 * Calculate LUT.
 * Does the calculation of the lookup table without extracting any further information
 * from the given buffer.
 *
 * @fn void ColormapGenerator::undo()
 * Undo last calls to consider().
 * This will eliminate all calls to consider() since the last call to
 * resetUndo(), reset() or object generation.
 *
 * @fn void ColormapGenerator::reset()
 * Reset the generator.
 * This throws away all results accumulated up to now and starts from scratch
 * with the generation process.
 *
 * @fn void ColormapGenerator::reset_undo()
 * Reset undo buffer.
 * This throws away all undo information and starts a new undo buffer.
 *
 * @fn bool ColormapGenerator::has_histograms()
 * Check if this generator has histograms.
 * @return true, if this generator has histograms, false otherwise
 *
 * @fn std::map< std::string, Histogram *> *  ColormapGenerator::get_histograms()
 * Get histograms.
 * @return a map of histograms, if any.
