 * to determine if an edge should be considered blocked and therefore
 * cannot be expanded during path search.

 * Note that the nodes may be passed in either ordering, therefore
 * you should not rely on a particular order, not even for directed
 * nodes!
 *
 * Further note that the method may not throw an exception. Handle
 * this internally appropriately.
