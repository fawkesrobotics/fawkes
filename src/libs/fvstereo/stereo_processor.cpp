 * @fn virtual void StereoProcessor::get_xyz(unsigned int px, unsigned int py, float *x, float *y, float *z) = 0
 * Get coordinates for pixel in camera coordinate system.
 * This retrieves coordinates in the coordinate system of the stereo camera.
 * Retrieving new positions may fail if no valid disparity information could
 * be calculated for the given point. This is indicated with the return value.
 * @param px x position of pixel in image
 * @param py y position of pixel in image
 * @param x upon successful return contains the x coordinate of the point in the camera coordinate sytem
 * @param y upon successful return contains the y coordinate of the point in the camera coordinate sytem
 * @param z upon successful return contains the z coordinate of the point in the camera coordinate sytem
 * @return true, if valid information could be retrieved and was written to (x,y,z), false otherwise
 *
 * @fn virtual void StereoProcessor::get_world_xyz(unsigned int px, unsigned int py, float *x, float *y, float *z) = 0
 * Get coordinates for pixel in robot coordinate system.
 * This retrieves coordinates in the coordinate system of the robot holding
 * the stereo camera. The robot coordinate system is a right-handed cardanic
 * coordinate system with the X axis pointing forward, the Y axis pointing
 * right and the Z axis pointing downwards.
 * Retrieving new positions may fail if no valid disparity information could
 * be calculated for the given point. This is indicated with the return value.
 * @param px x position of pixel in image
 * @param py y position of pixel in image
 * @param x upon successful return contains the x coordinate of the point in the robot coordinate sytem
 * @param y upon successful return contains the y coordinate of the point in the robot coordinate sytem
 * @param z upon successful return contains the z coordinate of the point in the robot coordinate sytem
 * @return true, if valid information could be retrieved and was written to (x,y,z), false otherwise
 *
 * @fn virtual void StereoProcessor::preprocess_stereo() = 0
 * Do any pre-processing needed.
 * Do all the preprocessing needed to calculate the disparity or the YUV images.
 * This has been split out to be able to do only one thing.
 *
 * @fn virtual void StereoProcessor::calculate_disparity(ROI *roi = 0) = 0
 * Caculate disparity images.
 * Depending on the data the specific stereo processor needs the disparity image
 * is calculated.
 * If a region of interest (ROI) is supplied then only this region is processed.
 * @param roi region of interest to process
 *
 * @fn virtual void StereoProcessor::calculate_yuv(bool both = false) = 0
 * Caculate yuv images.
 * This will calculate YUV images of the cameras. By default only the reference
 * image is converted to YUV, as this is sufficient in most cases. If you need both
 * images specify so as argument. A call to this method is valid only after calling
 * calculate_disparity() as this may rely on data produced there.
 * @param both if true, both YUV images are calculated for the left and right camera,
 * if false only the YUV image of the reference camera is calculated (dependant on
 * camera)
 *
 * @fn virtual unsigned char *  StereoProcessor::disparity_buffer() = 0
 * Get the disparity image buffer.
 * This returns a buffer containing the disparity image. The buffer is not copied
 * so do not change anything in the buffer or subsequent calls to get_xyz() and
 * get_world_xyz() will return invalid results.
 * @return disparity buffer
 *
 * @fn virtual size_t           StereoProcessor::disparity_buffer_size() const = 0
 * Get disparity buffer size.
 * @return size in bytes of the disparity image buffer
 *
 * @fn virtual unsigned char *  StereoProcessor::yuv_buffer_right() = 0
 * Get YUV-formatted buffer of reference camera.
 * This will return the YUV buffer of the reference image. This is only available
 * after calling calculate_yuv().
 * @return YUV buffer of the reference image
 *
 * @fn virtual unsigned char *  StereoProcessor::yuv_buffer_left() = 0
 * Get YUV-formatted buffer of left camera.
 * This will return the YUV buffer of the auxiliary image. This is only available
 * after calling calculate_yuv().
 * @return YUV buffer of the auxiliary image
