/** @class BlackBoardInterfaceObserver <blackboard/interface_observer.h>
 * BlackBoard interface observer.
 * Derive this class if you want to be notified of specific BlackBoard
 * events that are not tied to particular instances of interfaces like
 * create and destroy operations.
 *
 * The bb_interface_* methods are called during the appropriate operation. The
 * operation that you carry out in this event handler really has to be damn fast,
 * or the performance of the whole system will suffer severely. For this reason use
 * this notification facility only rarely and only register for the appropriate
 * events.
 *
 * This class provides the basic infrastructure that can be used to build
 * your own observer. During the life time of your observer you
 * first add all the interfaces to the appropriate structures that you want
 * to listen for and add the interface types where you want to be notified
 * of creation events.
 *
 * The interface created event is raised whenever an interface of a type that
 * you registered for is created. The destroyed event is raised if the an interface
 * is irrecoverable deleted from the BlackBoard. This happens when the last
 * reader or writer closes the interface. That means neither a writer nor any
 * reader has a particular interface still opened.
 *
 * Here is a simple life cycle of a BlackBoard interface observer:
 * First you add all the interface types that you want to observe with calls to
 * bbio_add_interface_create_type() and bbio_add_interface_destroy_type(). Then
 * you register the observer with InterfaceManager::register_observer(). From then
 * on you are notified of the events. Afterwards you unregister your observer
 * to no longer receive events.
