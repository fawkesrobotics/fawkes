The Fawkes Core Library includes core components that are required to write
basic fawkes plugins.  This is the lowest level in the Fawkes library stack
and must not depend  on any other libraries besides glibc and system calls.

The Fawkes Core Library provides several basic features  needed by the rest
of the software like:
 - Multi-Threading tools (threads, locking, synchronization)
 - Exceptions (base class for exceptions, basic generic exceptions)
 - Plugin (base class for Fawkes Plugins)
 - Core Utils (utility aspects for Fawkes software, see below)

In most cases if you look for a place to put you code you are wrong here in
the core library.  You must really know what you are doing. If in doubt ask
Tim Niemueller for decision making help for this. In general if you thought
you  should add  something to  core it is  likely that  the right  place is
somewhere in the Fawkes Utility Library.

You will note that here is also an utils directory which may make you think
even more that you want to put your code here.  But the utils is only meant
to host utilities that are
 - small in code size
 - needed in Fawkes components that cannot depend on utils
 - are widely used
 - fulfill an atomic task
 - will not be used but rather are  aspects of software that  you write and
   where classes derive these utility classes.

The exceptions directory is  _not_  a general place to put your exceptions.
It is only  meant to serve as a  repository of generic  exceptions that are
likely to be  re-used all  over the software.   On the  one hand  these are
system exceptions which are mainly applicable if the error was indicated or
described  via the  usage of errno.   On the other  hand these  are generic
software construction exceptions like null pointer exceptions.

Rule of thumb: Use Fawkes Core Library, don't hack it.
