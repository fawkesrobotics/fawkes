/** @class Mutex core/threading/mutex.h
 * Mutex mutual exclusion lock.
 * This class is used in a multi-threading environment to lock access to
 * resources. This is needed to prevent two threads from modifying a value
 * at the same time or to prevent a thread from getting a dirty copy of
 * a piece of data (the reader reads while a writer is writing, this could
 * leave the data in a state where the reader reads half of the new and half
 * of the old data).
 *
 * As a rule of thumb you should lock the mutex as short as possible and as
 * long as needed. Locking the mutex too long will lead in a bad performance
 * of the multi-threaded application because many threads are waiting for
 * the lock and are not doing anything useful.
 * If you do not lock enough code (and so serialize it) it will cause pain
 * and errors.
