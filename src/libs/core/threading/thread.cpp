/** @class Thread <core/threading/thread.h>
 * Thread class encapsulation of pthreads.
 * This is the base class for all threads in Fawkes. Derive this class for
 * your thread. Note that you have to set a meaningful name, as this name
 * is necessary for easier debugging and it is used for internal messaging
 * via the BlackBoard. Make sure that your name is unique throughout the
 * software. Using the class name with an additional modifier if it is instantiated
 * multiple times is a good bet.
 *
 * The thread can operate in two modes. The loop can either run continuously
 * without a brake, or it can wait for an explicit wakeup after each loop.
 * Waiting for an explicit wakeup is the default since this is the common use
 * case in Fawkes and also it is less risky, the developer will easier see that
 * his thread does not do anything then fixing that the thread takes all CPU time.
 *
 * Special care has been taken to allow for proper initialization and
 * finalization. The special behavior of this routines can only be guaranteed
 * if the threads are managed properly, which is the case if we speak of the
 * Fawkes thread manager. This applies for the following paragraphs.
 *
 * The thread provides an init() routine which may be implemented
 * and is called just before the thread is started. If you make use of aspects
 * this is the first time when you can make use of aspects. These aspects
 * are not initialized in the constructor. init() is called just after the
 * aspect initialization. This is also the last chance to stop the thread
 * from being executed if you detect an error. If init() throws any exception
 * then the thread is never started.
 *
 * The methods prepare_finalize(), finalize() and cancel_finalize() are meant
 * to be used for finalization. First prepare_finalize() is called to prepare
 * finalization. At this stage the thread can veto and prevent finalization
 * from happening. For this prepare_finalize_user() has to be implemented
 * with the proper check, and maybe special actions that are needed to
 * prepare finalization (which may or may not happen independent from the
 * result of just this thread, see method description). Afterwards finalize()
 * may be called (independent of the prepare_finalize() result, see method
 * description). If finalize() is not executed the thread is notified with
 * cancel_finalize(). Before finalize() is called the thread is stopped.
 *
 * The intialization and finalization procedures may be executed deferred and
 * concurrent to the running thread itself. The thread is only started however
 * it init() finished successfully.
 *
 * The call to prepare_finalize() is mutual exclusive with a concurrently running
 * loop() by default. This means that if the loop() blocks waiting for some event
 * prepare_finalize() will hang until this event happens. This can be prevented
 * with set_prepfin_conc_loop() which allows to set that prepare_finalize() and
 * loop() may be executed concurrently.
 *
 * After prepare_finalize() has been run the thread implementation will stop the
 * loop() from being executed. However, the thread will still run, for example it will
 * wait for wakeup. This way it can be ensured that other threads will continue
 * to run even this thread is currently not running. An exception is the
 * ThreadList. For this Thread provides special synchronization features by
 * which it is possible to stop a thread in the very same loop iteration. That
 * means that if you have two threads that are woken up at the same time and
 * maybe even synchronize among each other it is guaranteed that both threads
 * will finish the running loop and never enter the next loop.
 * Before finalize() is called the thread shall be stopped (cancelled and joined).
 *
 * Because the finalization is done deferred and concurrent put all lengthy
 * finalization routines in finalize() and avoid this in the destructor, since
 * a long running destructor will harm the overall performance while with the
 * surrounding framework a long-running finalize() is acceptable.
 *
 * Please read the Fawkes documentation about guarantees (FawkesGuarantees in
 * the wiki) for information about the given guarantees. Several of these
 * guarantees are met if Thread is used in conjunction with ThreadList and the
 * guarantees have been specifically designed for painless plugin development.

/** @var Mutex *  Thread::loop_mutex
 * Mutex that is used to protect a call to loop().
 * This mutex is locked just before loop() is called and unlocked right after it

 * method does not run while the loop runs.
 * For example assume that we have a method set_parameter(int x). This method may
 * only be called if loop() is not running or unpredictable results will occur.
 * To do this you could write the method as
 * @code
 * MyThread::set_parameter(int x)
 * {
 *   loopinterrupt_antistarve_mutex->lock();
 *   loop_mutex->lock();

/** @var Mutex *  Thread::loopinterrupt_antistarve_mutex
 * Mutex to avoid starvation when trying to lock loop_mutex.
 * If you want to interrupt the main loop only locking loop_mutex is not enough,
 * as this might make your try to lock it starve if the loop is running too fast
 * (for example on a continuous thread). Because of this you always need to
 * lock both mutexes. The anti-starve mutex will only be visited shortly and thus
 * allows you to lock it easily. This will then block the thread from trying to
 * lock the loop_mutex. See loop_mutex for an example.
