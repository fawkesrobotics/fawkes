/** @class Spinlock <core/threading/spinlock.h>
 * Spin lock.
 * This class is similar to a Mutex in that it is used in a multi-threading
 * environment to lock access to resources.
 *
 * The difference is that the spinlock will do a busy waiting until it acquires
 * the lock while the mutex would block and wait, and may even starve if another
 * threads releases a lock only for a short period of time.
 *
 * Spinlocks are risky, priority inversion may be caused if used improperly.
 * Be sure what you are doing if you use spinlocks.
