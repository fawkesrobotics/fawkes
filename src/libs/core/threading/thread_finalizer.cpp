/** @class ThreadFinalizer core/threading/thread_finalizer.h
 * Thread finalizer interface.
 * This interface is used by the ThreadManager. The finalize() method is called
 * for each thread that is about to be removed. If there are any special needs
 * that have to be finalized before the thread is stopped on the given real
 * classes of the thread this is the way to do it.
 *
 * The finalizer may abort the stopping of a thread by throwing a
 * CannotFinalizeThreadException. This can for example be used if you have two
 * threads A and B. A depends on B in that B is needed for A to run properly.
 * Now both threads are running and then B is called to stop. The finalize will
 * call threads B finalize() method, which fails (because it knows about the
 * dependency of A for example by some kind of register pattern). This tells the
 * thread manager not to stop B, because this would break A.
 *
 * See Fawkes main application for
 * an example.
