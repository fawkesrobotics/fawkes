 * Utility class to send transforms.
 * The transform publisher opens an instance of TransformInterface on
 * the blackboard for writing and publishes every transform through
 * that interface. Assuming that the event-based listener is used
 * it will catch all updates even though we might send them in quick
 * succession.

 * This simply calls send_transform() with a StampedTransform created
 * from the data pased into this method.

 * @param time time of the transform to publish
 * @param frame reference frame ID
 * @param child_frame child frame ID
