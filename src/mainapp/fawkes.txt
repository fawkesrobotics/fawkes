SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'fawkes' [-h] [-C] [-c db-file] [-d sql-file] [-q[qqq]] [-l level]
	[-L loggers] [-p plugins] [-u user] [-g group]
	[-Dpid-file] [-Dpid-file -k] [-Dpid-file -s]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program is the main application that provides the environment
for *Fawkes* plugins to run. When run, it creates the blackboard,
loads the configuration files and sets up the basic aspect
initializers required to initialize plugins.


OPTIONS
-------
 *-h*::
	Show help instructions.

 *-C*::
	Cleanup old BB segments. This is only required when using the
	old sysvipc shared memory blackboard (off by default).

 *-c* 'db-file'::
	Mutable configuration file, created if it does not exist. If
	it does however it must contain a valid SQLite
	database. 'db-file' is either the absolute path to the
	configuration database, or it is a path relative to the system
	configuration directory or the .fawkes directory in the user's
	home directory. In either case it should be suffixed by .db.

 *-d* 'sql-file'::
	Default configuration SQL dump file. On program startup the
	default configuration is imported from this file. On exit, it
	is written back. 'sql-file' is either an absolute path to the
	default.sql dump file or a path relative to the system
	configuration directory or the .fawkes directory in the user's
	home directory. In either case it should be suffixed by .sql.

 *-q[qqq]*::
	Quiet mode, -q omits debug, -qq debug and info, -qqq omit
	debug, info and warn, -qqqq no output of logger.

 *-l* 'level'::
	Set log level directly mutually exclusive with -q. 'level' is one
	of debug, info, warn, error and none.

 *-L* 'loggers'::
	Define loggers. By default this setting is read from config
	file (or console logger if unset in config). Format for
	'loggers' is: logger:args[;logger2:args2[!...]]. The logger
	options depend on the logger. Currently supported:
	console (default), file:file.log, network logger is always
	enabled.

 *-p* 'plugins'::
	Load the given plugins on startup. 'plugins' is a
	comma-separated list of plugins to load, for example
	fvbase,fvfountain,fvretriever. The plugins will be loaded in
	the given order after startup. An error to load any of these
	plugins will cause the successive plugins not to be loaded.

 *-u* 'user'::
	Drop privileges as soon as possible and run as given 'user'.

 *-g* 'group'::
	Drop privileges as soon as possible and run as given 'group'.

 *-D*'[pid-file]'::
	Run daemonized in the background, 'pid-file' is optional and
	defaults to /var/run/fawkes.pid, it must be an absolute path.

 *-D*'[pid-file]' *-k*::
	Kill a daemonized process running in the background. The 'pid-file'
	is used to determine the process ID and is optional as above.

 *-D*'[pid-file]' *-s*::
	Check status of daemon. The exit value can be used to check on
	the status. The 'pid-file' is used to determine the process ID
	and is optional as above.

Configuration
-------------
The configuration is stored in SQLite databases for fast retrieval.


EXAMPLES
--------

 *fawkes*::
	Run fawkes and await commands.

 *fawkes -p webview*::
	Run fawkes and load the webview plugin after startup. After
	this, you cann access Fawkes via http://localhost:10117 to
	load more plugins, read the logs or inspect the blackboard.
