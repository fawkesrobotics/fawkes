# Use Intel compiler, only icc >= 10.1 is supported

# We ignore several warnings that are not important to use (-wd flag):
# 177: entity-kind "entity" was declared but never referenced (like catch Exception, if just re-thrown or unused)
# 383: value copied to temporary, reference to temporary used
# 810: conversion from "type" to "type" may lose significant bits (like htons and double->float)
# 869: entity-kind "entity" was never referenced (unused parameters)
# 981: operands are evaluated in unspecified order (some string operations)
# 1418: external function definition with no prior declaration
# 1572: floating-point equality and inequality comparisons are unreliable
